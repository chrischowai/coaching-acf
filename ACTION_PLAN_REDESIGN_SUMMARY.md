### 6. User Workflow

1. **View**: User sees all action items from their coaching session

3. **Review Metrics**: Scroll to see success metrics from session
4. **Manage Actions**: Expand/collapse each action item to edit details
5. **Update Fields**: Edit any field, then click "Save Changes"
6. **Navigate**: Use bottom buttons to view coaching history or summary

### 7. Reminder Frequency Options

**Previous Options:**
- None
- Daily
- Weekly

**New Options:**
- None
- **Hourly** (NEW)
- Daily
- Weekly
- **Monthly** (NEW)

### 8. Backwards Compatibility

### 9. Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load action plan details page
- [ ] Verify all action items from session display
- [ ] Edit plan name successfully
- [ ] View success metrics (if available)
- [ ] Expand/collapse action item cards
- [ ] Edit action item fields and save
- [ ] Change reminder frequency (including new hourly/monthly options)
- [ ] Navigate to "Coaching History"
- [ ] Navigate to "Coaching Summary"
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport
- [ ] Test with sessions that have no success metrics
- [ ] Test with sessions that have multiple action items

### 10. Known Limitations

1. **Plan Name Storage**: Currently auto-generated from summary. If you want persistent custom names, you'd need to add a `plan_name` field to the database.

2. **Build Issue**: There's a pre-existing TypeScript path resolution issue in `lib/stores/sessionStore.ts` unrelated to these changes. The dev server works fine.

3. **Loading State**: While comprehensive, could benefit from skeleton loaders for a more polished feel.

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

3. **Bulk Actions**: Add ability to mark multiple items complete at once
4. **Progress Visualization**: Add overall completion progress bar
5. **Filtering**: Add filters for status/priority
6. **Sorting**: Allow reordering of action items
7. **Export**: PDF export of the entire action plan
8. **Notifications**: Implement actual reminder system based on frequency settings
