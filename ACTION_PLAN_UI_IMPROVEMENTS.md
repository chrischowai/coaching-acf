# Action Plan Details Page - UI Improvements

## Changes Implemented

This document outlines the three UI improvements made to the Action Plan Details page.

---

## 1. ✅ Enhanced "Back to Action Plans" Button

### Changes Made:
- **Larger size**: Changed from default size to `size="lg"`
- **Eye-catching design**: Added gradient background with colors from indigo to purple
- **Better visual appeal**: Added shadow effects (`shadow-lg` and `hover:shadow-xl`)
- **Larger icon**: Increased ArrowLeft icon from `h-4 w-4` to `h-5 w-5`

### Code Changes:
```tsx
// Before
<Button
  variant="ghost"
  onClick={() => router.push('/action-plans')}
  className="hover:bg-indigo-50"
>
  <ArrowLeft className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  Back to Action Plans
</Button>

// After
<Button
  onClick={() => router.push('/action-plans')}
  size="lg"
  className="bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-600 to-purple-600 hover:from-indigo-700 hover:to-purple-700 text-white shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all"
>
  <ArrowLeft className="mr-2 h-5 w-5" />
  Back to Action Plans
</Button>
```

## 2. ✅ Improved Page Title

### Changes Made:
- **Updated text**: Changed from "Action Plan Details" to "Details of Action Plan"
- **Larger font size**: Increased from `text-xl` to `text-2xl`
- **Center alignment**: Used absolute positioning with `left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2` for perfect centering
- **Better badge styling**: Enhanced badge size with `text-sm px-3 py-1`

### Layout Structure:
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  {/* Back Button (left) */}
  <Button>...</Button>
  
  {/* Centered Title */}
  <div className="absolute left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 flex items-center gap-4">
    <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">Details of Action Plan</h1>
    <Badge>...</Badge>
  </div>
  
  {/* Spacer for balance (right) */}
  <div className="w-[180px]"></div>
</div>
```

## 3. ✅ Delete Action Item Functionality

### Changes Made:
- **New delete button**: Added a red delete button with trash icon in the bottom-left corner of expanded action items
- **Confirmation dialog**: Shows a confirmation dialog before deleting
- **Loading state**: Button shows "Deleting..." text during the delete operation
- **Proper cleanup**: Removes item from all state arrays (items, editedItems, expandedItems)
- **Toast notifications**: Success/error messages after delete operation

### Implementation Details:

#### Added State:
```tsx
const [deletingItemId, setDeletingItemId] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

#### Delete Handler:
```tsx
const handleDelete = async (itemId: string) => {
  const item = items.find(i => i.id === itemId);
  if (!item) return;

  const confirmDelete = window.confirm(
    `Are you sure you want to delete this action item?\n\n"${item.title}"\n\nThis action cannot be undone.`
  );

  if (!confirmDelete) return;

  try {
    setDeletingItemId(itemId);
    await deleteActionPlan(itemId);
    
    // Remove from local state
    setItems(prev => prev.filter(i => i.id !== itemId));
    
    // Clean up edited and expanded states
    setEditedItems(prev => {
      const newSet = new Set(prev);
      newSet.delete(itemId);
      return newSet;
    });
    
    setExpandedItems(prev => {
      const newSet = new Set(prev);
      newSet.delete(itemId);
      return newSet;
    });

    toast.success('Action item deleted successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting action item:', error);
    toast.error('Failed to delete action item');
  } finally {
    setDeletingItemId(null);
  }
};
```

#### UI Layout (in expanded section):
```tsx
<div className="flex justify-between items-center pt-2">
  {/* Delete button (left) */}
  <Button
    variant="destructive"
    size="sm"
    onClick={() => handleDelete(item.id)}
    disabled={deletingItemId === item.id}
    className="bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700"
  >
    <Trash2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
    {deletingItemId === item.id ? 'Deleting...' : 'Delete Action'}
  </Button>
  
  {/* Save button (right) - only shows when there are changes */}
  {hasChanges && (
    <Button
      onClick={() => handleSave(item.id)}
      disabled={isSaving}
      className="bg-orange-600 hover:bg-orange-700"
    >
      <Save className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
      Save Changes
    </Button>
  )}
</div>
```

## Testing Checklist

After applying these changes, verify:

- [ ] Back button is larger and has gradient styling
- [ ] Back button navigates to action plans list page
- [ ] Title reads "Details of Action Plan" and is centered
- [ ] Title is larger (text-2xl) and clearly visible
- [ ] Delete button appears in expanded action items (bottom-left)
- [ ] Clicking delete shows confirmation dialog with item title
- [ ] Confirming delete removes the item from the list

## Notes

- The delete function uses the existing `deleteActionPlan` from `@/lib/supabase/action-plans`
- The confirmation uses native browser `window.confirm()` - consider upgrading to a custom modal for better UX
- All state cleanup is handled properly to prevent memory leaks
- The delete button is positioned on the left, while the save button (when there are changes) is on the right
