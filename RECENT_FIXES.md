# Recent Fixes - Session Summary & History View

## Issue 1: Exit Confirmation Missing ✅ FIXED

### Problem
When users finished a coaching session and generated a summary, they could accidentally click "Back to Home" or "Complete Session" and lose the summary page without warning.

### Solution
Added a confirmation dialog that appears when users try to leave the summary page.

**File Modified:** `src/components/InteractiveCoachingSession.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
1. Created `handleExitWithConfirmation()` function that shows a confirmation dialog
2. Applied this function to both exit buttons:
   - "Back to Home" button in header
   - "Complete Session" button in sidebar

**Confirmation Message:**
```
Are you sure you want to leave this page?

Make sure you have saved or printed your coaching summary before leaving.
```

**User Flow:**
1. User completes all 5 stages and sees summary
2. User clicks "Back to Home" or "Complete Session"
3. Confirmation dialog appears ⚠️
4. User can choose:
   - **Cancel** → Stay on summary page
   - **OK** → Return to home page

## Issue 2: Session History View - 404 Error ✅ FIXED

### Problem
When clicking "View" button on a session in Session History, users got:
- **Error:** "404 - Page could not be found"
- **Console Error:** Permission error (403) from a browser extension

### Root Cause
The "View" button navigated to `/sessions/${session.id}`, but this dynamic route page didn't exist in the codebase.

### Solution
Created a new dynamic route page to display individual session details.

**File Created:** `src/app/sessions/[id]/page.tsx`

**Features:**
1. **Session Overview Card**
   - Shows session type (Coach-Led or Self-Coaching)
   - Displays creation date
   - Shows completion status
   - Visual progress for all 5 stages

2. **Stage Navigation**
   - 5 clickable stage cards
   - Visual indicators:
     - ✅ Green for completed stages
     - Gray for stages with data but not completed
     - Disabled/faded for stages not started
   - Shows message count for each stage

3. **Conversation Display**
   - Shows full conversation history for selected stage
   - Messages styled with user/AI coach avatars
   - Preserves original formatting
   - Shows completion timestamp

4. **Error Handling**
   - Loading state while fetching data
   - "Session not found" message if invalid ID
   - Automatic redirect to sessions list on error

**User Flow:**
1. User goes to Session History (`/sessions`)
2. User clicks "View" on any session
3. New page loads showing session overview
4. User can click any stage card to view that stage's conversation
5. User can click "Back to Sessions" to return

## Technical Details

### Dynamic Route Structure
```
src/app/sessions/
  ├── page.tsx              # Session list page
  └── [id]/
      └── page.tsx          # Individual session view (NEW)
```

### Data Flow
```
User clicks "View"
    ↓
Navigate to /sessions/[id]
    ↓
SessionViewPage component loads
    ↓
Call getSession(sessionId) from Supabase
    ↓
Fetch session + stage_responses
    ↓
Display in interactive UI
```

### Browser Extension Error Note
The 403 permission error you saw (`exceptions.UserAuthError`) was from a browser extension trying to inject code, NOT from your app. This is unrelated to the 404 error and can be ignored.
