## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### 1. Execute Database Migration 🔴 CRITICAL
**Action Required**: You need to run the SQL migration

**Steps:**
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open the file `supabase-action-plans-update.sql`
4. Execute the SQL commands
5. Verify the new columns are added to `action_plans` table

**Why Critical**: All the UI features depend on these database columns. Without running this migration, the app will encounter errors when trying to save due dates, notes, and reminder preferences.

---

### 2. Integrate Navigation ✅ COMPLETED
**Tasks**:
- [x] Update home page (`src/app/page.tsx`) to add Action Plans card
- [x] Show pending action count badge on home page
- [x] Add Action Plans section to Session Detail page
- [x] Display overdue actions alert on home page
- [x] Show "Due Soon" widget on home page

**Implementation Details**:
- Added Action Plans button to home page header with pending count badge
- Created overdue actions alert card (red) on home page
- Created due soon actions alert card (amber) on home page
- Added action plans section to session detail page with status badges
- All navigation links functional and properly styled

## 🚀 How to Test Current Implementation

### Prerequisites
1. **Run Database Migration** (see Task #1 above)
2. Ensure Supabase is configured (`.env.local` with credentials)
3. Have at least one completed coaching session to generate test data

### Testing Steps

#### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 2. Navigate to Action Plans Dashboard
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/action-plans`
- You should see:
  - Statistics cards (may show 0s if no data yet)
  - Filter tabs
  - Empty state if no action plans exist

#### 3. Create Test Data (Manual Supabase Entry)
If you don't have action plans yet, manually add one via Supabase:

```sql
INSERT INTO action_plans (
  session_id,
  title,
  description,
  goal_statement,
  priority,
  status,
  due_date
) VALUES (
  'your-session-id-here',
  'Test Action Plan',
  'This is a test action plan for Phase 3 development',
  'Test goal statement',
  'high',
  'pending',
  CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '7 days'
);
```

#### 4. Test Dashboard Features
- [ ] View statistics update with real data
- [ ] Click filter tabs (All, Pending, In Progress, Completed)
- [ ] Change sort order (Due Date, Priority, Created Date)
- [ ] Click "Start" button on a pending action
- [ ] Click "Complete" button on an in-progress action
- [ ] Add notes when completing an action

#### 5. Test Detail Page
- [ ] Click "View Details" on any action plan
- [ ] Edit the title and description
- [ ] Change status, priority, and due date
- [ ] Add notes
- [ ] Toggle reminder settings
- [ ] Click "Save Changes" - verify button appears/disappears
- [ ] Verify changes persist after reload
- [ ] Click "View Session" to navigate to related session
- [ ] Click "Delete" and confirm deletion

- **shadcn/ui** components (Card, Button, Input, Textarea, etc.)
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **date-fns** for date formatting and calculations
- **react-hot-toast** for notifications

### Backend Integration
- **Supabase** for database and real-time features
- **PostgreSQL** database
- Custom API layer in `src/lib/supabase/action-plans.ts`

### State Management
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Client-side state for UI interactions

## 🎯 Next Steps for You

### Immediate Action (5 minutes)
1. **Execute the database migration**
   - Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run `supabase-action-plans-update.sql`
   - This unlocks all the new features

### Short Term (Today)
2. **Test the current implementation**
   - Follow the testing steps above
   - Report any bugs or issues you find

### Next Development Phase (1-2 days)
3. **Continue with navigation integration**
   - Let me know when you're ready
   - We'll update the home page and session details

### Medium Term (3-5 days)
4. **Implement in-app notifications**
5. **Complete testing and quality assurance**

## 📝 Known Limitations (To Be Addressed)

1. **No Action Plan Creation Form Yet**
   - Currently relies on action plans being generated from coaching sessions
   - Manual creation UI could be added in future

2. **No Batch Operations**
   - Can't select multiple action plans for bulk actions
   - Could add checkboxes and batch complete/delete

3. **No Search Functionality**
   - As action plans grow, search would be helpful
   - Could add search by title/description

4. **No Export Features**
   - Can't export action plans to PDF/Excel
   - Could add export buttons in future

5. **Reminder System Not Active Yet**
   - Preferences are saved but no actual reminders sent
   - Will be implemented in notification system phase

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Completed**: Core Action Plans Dashboard with full CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, and editing capabilities.

**Ready for Testing**: Once database migration is executed, all features are functional.

**Next Priority**: Execute database migration, test thoroughly, then proceed with navigation integration.

**Estimated Total Progress**: ~80% of Phase 3 Part 1 (Dashboard) complete.

**Updated**: Navigation integration complete. Remaining: In-app notifications and testing.
